ðŸ“Œ Project Bio 

PaperFetch is a Python-based command-line application designed to streamline academic research. It integrates with the PubMed API to search and retrieve research papers based on custom queries. The tool filters results by author affiliation (e.g., pharmaceutical or biotech companies) and exports structured metadata â€” including titles, authors, journals, and publication years â€” into CSV format.

This project highlights proficiency in:

Python scripting & automation

API integration & data parsing

Command-line interface (CLI) design

Data handling with CSV (pandas)

By transforming unstructured search results into organized datasets, PaperFetch helps researchers and analysts quickly identify relevant industry-authored publications.
